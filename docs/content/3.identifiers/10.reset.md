# Reset CSS

`reset[<meyer|novout>]`

This identifier does not generate a class in the specific HTML element, but a sequence of classes at the beginning of the CSS file generated by Ununura in order to reset CSS without having to create a .css file separately in your application.

It is recommended to use this identifier in the first HTML element in your framework.
